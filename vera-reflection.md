#A markdown reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    * I was struggling with the distinction between "git pull" and "git fetch" + "git merge"
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    * I now understand the distinction between "git pull" and "git fetch" + "git merge". I also understand what "origin" refers to (the remote repo) as well as what a HEAD is.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    * What the syntax for creating and inline image was.
* What still confuses you about Git?
    * I feel like I understand the concepts I am supposed to up until this point fairly well. That being said up until now I have been approving all of my own pull requests so I am curious to see what the workflow will be like when merge approval is dependent upon a collaborative relationship. Generally feeling optimistic and excited. 
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    * It was nice to have a guide to mentor me in unclear situations, however my pair had to reschedule last minute so it was a solo GPS session. Which I imagine is a bit different since I was playing role of both the driver and the navigator.
